# Chromotherapy

The first web app I designed on my own with Rails. Its purpose is to record
usersâ€™ emotional reactions to colors in a database. Users log on and expose 
themselves to specific shades then complete surveys with their reactions.
Admin users have access to the data gathered by these surveys

I used Ruby, Rails, HTML and CSS.
